## A tool to modify Palette 2 mcf.gcode files

Palette 2 is a hardware to enable a 3D printer to print multi colored objects or objects
of different materials.


This a a small python script I wrote to modify the extrusion speed while doing side transitions.
Side transitions offers the possibility to save filament compared to a transition tower.

Unfortunately the files produced by the web based Mosaic Canvas slicer software contains very fast flow rates
while doing site transitions to change materials.

The script empowers you to change this extrusion speed.
